<h1>Shopping Cart Exercise</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This is an exercise I did in Week 19 of MIT xPRO Professional Certificate In Coding: Full Stack Development With MERN course, to display my web development progress. In this exercise, you are able to fill your cart with apples, oranges, beans, or cabbage. The quantity in stock is updated and will not go below zero. The total cost of items placed in the shopping cart is calculated under 'Checkout'.

<h2>Installation</h2>
Download the files found in the repo. Install and use Strapi for the doFetch function to operate.

<h2>Usage</h2>
N/A

<h2>Support</h2>
For more information please email me: <b>dylanmpgh@gmail.com</b>

<h2>Roadmap</h2>
In the future I hope to add on to this project to display my progress as I become a better web developer.
